--- getting started

<p>
note: this section is only for people who want to contribute to pugl itself.
</p>

<p>
after cloning the <a href="https://github.com/pommicket/pugl" target="_blank">repository</a>,
make sure you run
<pre><code>npm install
ln -s ../../pre-commit .git/hooks/</code></pre>

this ensures that your changes are prettified &amp; linted.
</p>

<p>
the main files of interest are <code>index.html</code> and <code>pugl.js</code>, which has all
the JavaScript for pugl (hopefully it doesn't become too unmanageable to have just one file).
</p>

<p>
you can run <code>make</code> to generate a <code>public/</code> directory which has just the files
that should be hosted.
</p>

<h3>contributing to the guide</h3>
<p>
the guide is automatically generated from the files in <code>guide-src/</code> by <code>guide-src/make.py</code>
(you can also just run <code>make</code> to generate it), which is a simple script whose main purpose is adding
a sidebar to all of the guide pages. any PNG/JPG/SVG files are automatically copied from <code>guide-src/</code> to <code>guide/</code>.
when you add or remove pages from the guide, you'll need to edit <code>guide-src/outline.txt</code>.
